"To destroy is always the first step in any creation." - E. E. Cummings

We live in a world of social networking. We have a vast abundance of information in front of us each day. In fact the information we have is so much that we often forget what is important. 
We would like to change this. By providing a medium which filters out the essence of what’s happening around you, we bring you the raw news. 

Nybles is an ambitious idea to bring forward the tech happenings around you.

# Nybles

A Tech newsletter of IIIT Allahabad.

There is a huge problem we face, we often don’t realise how many amazing things that are happening around us. You might not even know about the awesome things your dorm-mate made or the things your friends have built. Maybe because he is too introverted to show it around. 
With this initiative we will try our best to update you about the things that are happening in our campus. 

We also bring your attention to the trends that are changing our industry from the perspective of your fellow colleagues.

Being a new initiative we want you to support us in taking this idea to the next level.

"Anybody can write"  is a motto we follow at Nybles, maybe not for the grammar bit, but we are sure you have an idea which you want to express to everyone. 

So, if you have an idea, see "Adding my article" and get your article published for everyone to see. Your idea maybe the next thing that could change everything.
