# What has IIIT Allahabad been up to this past week?

IIIT Allahabad has been programming, solving, clue-hunting, soldering, gaming, laughing, learning, and last but not the least, dancing alongwith a lot of guests from various colleges across the country.

Aparoksha returned for its third iteration this year, with anyone who likes to code, to build circuits, to design  or is in any case interested in the world of computers and electronics being treated to a wide variety of events suited to everyone'skills  sets - with an equal dose of fun to keep the stress levels minimal.

![Theme: Skynet](https://scontent-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17458246_399838953717296_1560409670839703533_n.jpg?oh=bac23cf2e52c48a4556a513507837825&oe=5956A8EC)
#### This year's theme was "Laying the foundations of Skynet." All events had some elements to it that reflected the theme. This cool looking logo was one of the more prominent declarations of the theme. 




## What "events" do you speak of?
*  **Github and IIIT Allahabad present Hack in the North**, the country's biggest student held hackathon. Yes, you read that right. The theme this year was "The Common Man", with accessible technologies and hardware builds being at the forefront of 36 hour long development extravaganza. The selection process was very thorough with only the best of the best getting in. Food, drinks, t-shirts, swag, goodies and enviable prizes worth INR 100,000: this hackathon had it ***all***.

(Here's *almost* everyone who made Hack In the North 2017 special.)

   
*  **Humblefool Cup**, a competitive coding event named after the [TopCoder handle](https://www.topcoder.com/members/humblefool/) of Late Harsha Suryanarayana sir, lovingly called "Lord Harsha" by his juniors - one of the best competitive programmers in India. This carried a cash prize of $500 in the onsite round.

(Yes, we had medals. 
We're nice people.)


* The **IT quiz** for all the techno-freaks out there.
* **GitHero**, for those who think the quality of their commits and merges is the equivalent of 300 year aged wine.
* **Counter Strike and FIFA** in all their glory. Nothing much to say here, except we had projectors and other cool stuff.


* **Aparoksha CTF, a Capture the flag tournament** for the people who've got astounding skills at web and file exploits, as well as WR1T1NG L1K3 TH15 and an unrelenting fondness for the words "n00b" and "pwn". The aim here was to capture the flag (an obscure string of text, not like Shia LaBeouf's "He Will Not Divide Us" shenanigan.) 


* * **TopBot** was the flagship Electronics event, with two sub events: The Obstacle Course robot building contest as well as the Line Follower robot building contest.

Cool Robot incoming: 
![How cool is this robot](https://scontent-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17498929_399838527050672_4426784627955326913_n.jpg?oh=a28d173bde8823a09c4f815044779377&oe=59570604)

* * **Creative Slam** was a graphics design competition for the more aesthetic computer fanatics.
* **Perplexus**, the bi-annual online treasure hunt.
* **Treasure Hunt**, the good old campus wide event.
* Now, the new 'uns of the campus couldn't be left out of the loop, and hence we had two special events for first year students:
1. **C Fresh**: A two round competitive coding contest exclusively for these new coders. 
2. **Tri Hacker Cup**: The final round of the four-round long TriHacker Cup concluded during Aparoksha, which was a web development round.   

There were a total of about 30 events held, from fields as diverse as back end web development  to circuit redesigning and many multi-skill events such as the Tri techathlon. 

# Is that all there was to it? Events?

##### Not Quite. 
The fest kicked off with a grand opening ceremony with various cultural performances to boot.  

We had a big, big variety of events to keep everyone busy.  


![Slightly big famous comedian](https://scontent-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17522671_399838717050653_7096135555187037424_n.jpg?oh=a16316ebace0b38a0de7f3040fa8694f&oe=59607B39)

One of the best stand up comedians of the country, YouTube sensation Karunesh Talwar came to perform on the 25th of March. The entire audience was in splits during and by the end, everyone wanted an encore performance, which was expected since this was the first time our college bore witness to a stand up show. 

![Tech Talks](https://scontent-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17523286_399838493717342_8153103870024486071_n.jpg?oh=f0a5e5b055945b13d574a305937e65d3&oe=596B9A3B)

Many tech talks were held throughout the duration of the techfest to spread awareness about things as diverse as making your LinkedIn profile shine to building a Data Analytics pipeline. (Come on, that rhymed. It's not that rare a thing.) 


The Closing ceremony was held to award prizes to the winners of a few special events as well as the overall best partcipants.
They got nice trophies.

The DJ was called in to release the stress and pain of having participated and worked this hard to make the fest a roaring success. (The attendees' words, not mine.) And oh, waas that a befitting end to Aparoksha. 

![Dance Dance I'm falling apart to half time](https://scontent-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17499116_399838977050627_6267884425073860755_n.jpg?oh=b7dde9908eb6d4d0327f60354b719685&oe=595B431F)


 ## And just like that, Aparoksha 2017 came to an end.
